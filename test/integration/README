This directory contains the scripts and test data supporting a simple
set of integration tests.

Directory Contents:

    README              - this README text file

    cert                - directory containing test certificate (.pem) files

    key                 - directory containing test key files

    ski                 - directory to hold test .ski files (produced by
                          kmyth-seal and used by kmyth-unseal and kmyth-getkey) 

    testrunner.py       - Python script implementing integration tests.

    sampleTestServer.py - Python script implementing sample test server

The integration tests must be invoked from the kmyth root directory (../..)
by invoking either:

    make integration-test

or

    ./test/integration/testrunner.py

In order to support some basic testing, an implementation of a very simple
server, written in Python, is included.  This is provided for research and
testing purposes only and is not considered suitable for operational use.

This server accepts TLS connections and provides a hard-coded,
fixed 256-bit byte array over a TLS socket to clients that connect.

The server has been setup so that it can be invoked as a daemon. When started,
it will serve the fixed 256-bit byte array forever, until stopped.
  
Starting and Stopping the Sample Test Server independently:

    The sample test server can be started by running (in kmyth root directory):

        ./test/integration/sampleTestServer.py start &


    Similarly, the sample test server can be stopped with:

        ./test/integration/sampleTestServer.py stop

Running the sample test server in this fashion, it will listen at the localhost
(127.0.0.1) address on ephemeral port 54321. The port setting can be
re-configured by editing the sampleTestServer.py script.
